Welcome to Kirby!
=================

Every Kirby site has three important directories:

* **content:** this is where your pages and blog posts go ([Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files).
* **media:** this is where static files like CSS, images, and JavaScripts go.
* **templates:** this is where your [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) template files go.
