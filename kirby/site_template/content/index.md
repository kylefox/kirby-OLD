## Congratulations!

You've managed to get a spiffy new Kirby site set up.  That wasn't so bad, was it?  You're probably wondering what to do next.  Here's what we recommend:

* Familiarize yourself with [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/).

When you're ready to take the plunge, delete *all* files inside the content, media, and templates directories.  Or just run `kirby reset` inside your project.
